    <div class="w-container">
      <p>Hi, my name is Marc Heinrich, and I am a sophomore studying Political Science and History. From my experience as a University Senate staffer, I would be able to hit the ground running with initiatives directly impacting students, like expanding
        group study space and updating Columbia’s technological infrastructure. I would also be committed to increasing transparency in the Senate, and ensuring that your Senators are serving student interests to the best of our abilities. If elected,
        I would have more than two years to work on these and other initiatives, an important consideration for a legislative body prone to stalemate.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section grey" id="page-nav-1">
    <div class="w-container">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <img class="wrap" src="images/sveus0968s.jpg" alt="sveus0968s.jpg">
      <p><strong>About the Senate:</strong> The University Senate is a legislative body representing students, faculty, and administrators across all of Columbia's schools. The body is tasked with developing and implementing policies that affect more than
        one school, and addressing concerns on a university-wide scale. The senate itself is comprised of 108 voting members, including 24 students from the schools, 63 faculty members, and 8 administrators. This is different from CCSC, which is comprised
        only of students and considers policies affecting Columbia College and allocates funds to all Columbia governing boards and student groups. There are three senators who represent the interests of Columbia College students.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Why me: </strong>As the only current staffer running for the Senate, I will be able to use my experience to bring greater transparency and new ideas. As a staffer, I have had the opportunity to work on many initiatives, such as the Quality
        of Life Survey (an in-depth survey conducted of all 28,000+ students), expanding online learning at Columbia, working to keep library study spaces open later, advocating for CUIT to update campus technology, and bringing the Senate Website into
        the 21st century (one of the most archaic looking websites at Columbia, seriously, check it out at senate.columbia.edu).</p>
    </div>

  <div class="section" id="page-nav-2">
    <div class="w-container">
      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p>My number one priority is making the Senate more transparent and relevant to the student body. It is disconcerting to hear students say they do not feel the Senate affects their daily lives, and I believe reform is needed to ensure the Senate is
        held accountable to the student body. Below are a couple of ideas I would like to implement to rectify this and make the Senate more transparent:
        <br>
        <br><strong>Semester Town Hall Meetings: </strong> 
        <br>As Senator, I would hold town hall meetings every semester to solicit student feedback and ensure that Columbia College student voices are heard. Because the Senate represents so many students and faculty, it can be easy for Senators to forget
        their primary constituency. Through these meetings, students would be able to contribute new ideas and provide feedback on current initiatives.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Senate Confidentiality Guidelines: </strong> 
        <br>Currently, all Senate committee meetings are considered executive sessions due to the confidentiality guidelines followed by the Senate, meaning that outside students and faculty are not allowed to attend. As Senator, I would like to pursue changes
        to make these sessions non-executive by default, and require committee co-chairs to publicly justify executive sessions. Moreover, I would push to have every committee vote at the beginning of each academic year whether or not to publicly publish
        its minutes. While there exist several committees, such as Faculty Affairs, Academic Freedom, and Tenure, which would most likely choose to keep their minutes confidential, I believe with more flexibility, other committee minutes could be made
        available. These minutes would allow students, the press, and the public to know more about what is happening in the Senate. The current guidelines are available at http://senate.columbia.edu/archives/reports_archive/10-11/confidentiality_guidelines_4-29-11.html
        <br>
        <br><strong>Working with CCSC &amp; Student government:</strong>
        <br>CC’s University Senators are also members of Columbia College Student Council (CCSC). Because of this membership, I would push for greater collaboration between the two bodies. Many issues currently under review by CCSC, such as improving the
        printing process at Columbia, are areas the Senate should address as well. As Senator, I would ensure that effective communication exists between the two bodies in order to best serve student interests.</p>

      <h2>My Ideas</h2>
      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <p><u><strong>Short-Term Ideas</strong></u>
            <br>As the only current Senate staffer, my experience will allow me to begin immediately pursuing short-term projects.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Expand Bike Share as a CU-wide
program: </strong>
            <br>While the EcoReps’ popular Bike Share program was only launched just this past year, it has proven incredibly popular with University students. However, the program currently is only available to a limited number of undergraduates in Columbia
            College and the Engineering School due to lack of funding and resources. As Senator, I would push for the program to be expanded and fully funded for all of Columbia. This free and environmentally conscious program should be prioritized to
            receive the minimal funding it needs. Additionally, the Bike Share would provide an efficient way for students to travel to and from the Manhattanville Campus upon its completion.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Update Technology: </strong>
            <br>As Senator, I would work with the Information and Communications Technology Committee to modify many of Columbia’s policies relating to technology.
            <br>
            <br><em><strong>Display Full Names on Emails
Addresses:</strong><br></em> § I would like to encourage CUIT to display students’ full names on emails. This suggestion, which came from WTF Columbia, would allow for emails sent from Columbia addresses to appear more professional to outside employers.
            <br>
            <br><em><strong>Create a Universal Printing
System</strong><br></em> § CUIT could change our current dysfunctional NINJa print system to the more modern PHAROS system, which already exists at Columbia Medical School. PHAROS allows for a student to submit their project to a global queue and then
            print that project from any University printer. As Senator, I would advocate for PHAROS on behalf of the Columbia student body.
            <br>
            <br><em><strong>Expedite Google Drive Implementation</strong><br></em> § Currently, Google Docs are scheduled to become available to Columbia University students in 2015. As Senator, I would like to investigate why the implementation is so far
            removed, and work to expedite the process.
            <br>
            <br><em><strong>Charging Stations in Butler and
Lerner</strong><br></em> § As Senator, I would push for charging stations to be available in Butler and Lerner for different types of phones and laptops. These stations are currently available in the Diana Center in Barnard College, and have allowed Barnard
            students to get a brief charge on their laptop or phone while saving them a trip to their dorm room to retrieve their charger. The effective stations should be available on this side of Broadway as well. o
            <br>
            <br><strong><em>Open Data</em></strong>
            <br>§ Over the years, Columbia has collected an immense amount of data related to student life through surveys, course evaluations, and other mediums. Even more data is collected on students every day, ranging from swipe-in rates in John Jay to
            numbers relating to sexual assaults at Columbia. As Senator, I would work with administrators to put as much of this data as possible in the hands of Columbia students.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Honor
Code: </strong>
            <br>As Senator, I would work closely with members of the Education Committee to implement a university-wide honor code. Last year, Steven Castellano, the Academic Affairs Representative for CCSC (CC ’13) and the rest of the board did amazing work
            in implementing an honor code for Columbia College. I would like to expand this code as a University-wide covenant, allowing for all 28,000+ students to have the same standards in regards to academic integrity.
            <br>· Specific schools that currently have an honor code would be able to expand on the more-general University-wide version. While a University-wide code is an ambitious goal, such a code exits in large schools around the nation, like the University
            of Virginia. Through both time and effort, such a code could come to fruition
            <br>· An honor code is not a catchall solution to academic dishonesty. However, a united effort on a University-wide front would be an important step in the right direction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <p><strong><u>Long-Term Ideas</u></strong>
            <br>As the only sophomore candidate, I would have more than two years to pursue long-term projects.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Quality of Life Survey: </strong>
            <br>As a Senate staffer, I have already spent hours analyzing and evaluating the results of the University’s first Quality of Life survey, an amazing initiative to get student input on policies from all 28,000+ students. If elected, I would be
            in the position to jump right into using the survey’s empirical data to drive Senate policy recommendations. I would push for this survey to be implemented on a bi-annual basis to ensure that future policies at Columbia are based on student
            feedback.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Use
WTF Columbia to garner more feedback:</strong> 
            <br>WTF Columbia is an efficient and effective way to crowdsource feedback on policy changes at Columbia. As Senator, I would work with CCSC to use WTF Columbia to fix campus-wide problems. The site has already generated many great ideas I would
            like to see implemented, such as putting full names on our Columbia email addresses, and allowing real-time space availability requests through UEM.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Academics:</strong> 
            <br><em>Online
Learning: </em> 
            <br>§ The Senate has already begun work to ensure Online Learning is an accessible option for Columbia students. As a Staffer, I have spent much time determining how Columbia can expand its online presence and increase the availability of classes,
            and I would continue this work as an elected Senator.
            <br>
            <br><em>Teaching
Assistant Policy:</em> 
            <br>§ There should be a standardized training program for TAs so that they understand how to perform their jobs. Many TAs wish they had some formal instruction before starting – a move that would also benefit students in lectures.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Divestment:</strong>
            <br>In 2012, Barnard Columbia Divestment launched a campaign to encourage Columbia to divest its $8.2 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry. I support BCD's resolution, and would work within the Senate to encourage administrators to
            implement these changes to Columbia's investment policies.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Space:</strong> 
            <br><em>Libraries</em> 
            <br>§ One of the biggest issues at Columbia is Space and I believe there should be more study spaces, especially for groups, open later.
            <br>§ During Finals last year, Butler 5 and 6 were open 24 hours a day. However, because it wasn’t being used at certain times, they did not have extended hours. As Senator, I would work with the Libraries and Digital Resources Committee to figure
            out a sensible solution that allows for the extra space to be open for a longer period of time during Midterms and Finals. ·
            <br>
            <br> <strong>Gender-Inclusive Bathrooms: </strong> 
            <br>It is important that all members of our community feel comfortable in all campus locations, from the classrooms to the restrooms. Providing gender-inclusive bathrooms is a great step towards achieving this goal.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Morningside
Student Space Initiative:</strong>
            <br>One of Columbia's perennial concerns is a lack of physical space on campus. In acknowledgement of Columbia's imminent expansion into Manhattanville, I would spend time working with administrators and members of the Campus Planning Committee
            to ensure that group study space is prioritized when planning new uses of space on our Morningside campus.
            <br>
            <br><strong>CU Dems’ Sexual Assault Campaigns:  </strong>
            <br>CU Dems has launched a powerful and important effort to disclose information on the number of sexual assaults that occur at Columbia. I fully support this effort and encourage you to sign their petition below.</p>
